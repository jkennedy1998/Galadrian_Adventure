//hey! this is just for posting ideas to implement in the game without clogging up other class's data.
//formatting below
//new idea
//  aspects of new idea
//      personal comment about idea

//items that players will get
//  items will be kept equipped and not be usable.
//  will edit stats and modifiers temporarily while they are equipted.
//  they can be broken (armor broken one it receives a certain ammount of damage)
//  they are dropped by monsters or are dropped by the story class through the main quest.
//  items that are non usable will be stored in itemDirectory.
//  new argument for items to declare if item is usable.

//atacks and items affecting certain monster types more than others
//  bug like creatures (snakes spiders and bats) will be affected by an item more than a giant. (more dam)
//  new arg in monster where we do a integer id of a monster type. (ie 1 = bugLike, 2 = largeHumanoid)
//      would make a higher level of tactical thinking for the player.

//changing accuracy
//  changing to accuracy percentages as a double. or an int out of 100
//      would make it easier to scale monsters and players. makes modifiers do more and less in extreem cases.

//Changing Variable
//    Making an object where all variables are tied to the single object to make it more condensed

//time
//real time effects monsters who show up
// or in game time does. in game time could be 0 to 24 as a double. each turn would add .1 to the counter.
//each round would add half an hour (.5 to 1)
//end of day you can level up.
//resting at end of day.
//chances to get raided based on if you set up traps or ate.
//eating and setting up traps would cause you to sleep less and therefore gain less health.

//locations based off of character.
//mage light or sparks would give you ability to access caves.
