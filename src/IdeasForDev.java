//hey! this is just for posting ideas to implement in the game without clogging up other class's data.
//formatting below
//new idea
//  aspects of new idea
//      personal comment about idea

//items that players will get
//  they can be broken (armor broken one it receives a certain ammount of damage)
//  they are dropped by monsters or are dropped by the story class through the main quest.

//attacks and items affecting certain monster types more than others
//  bug like creatures (snakes spiders and bats) will be affected by an item more than a giant. (more dam)
//  new arg in monster where we do a integer id of a monster type. (ie 1 = bugLike, 2 = largeHumanoid)
//      would make a higher level of tactical thinking for the player.

//Changing Variable
//    Making an object where all variables are tied to the single object to make it more condensed
