//hey! this is just for posting ideas to implement in the game without clogging up other class's data.
//formatting below
//new idea
//  aspects of new idea
//      personal comment about idea

//attacks and items affecting certain monster types more than others
//  bug like creatures (snakes spiders and bats) will be affected by an item more than a giant. (more dam)
//  new arg in monster where we do a integer id of a monster type. (ie 1 = bugLike, 2 = largeHumanoid)
//      would make a higher level of tactical thinking for the player.

//Changing Variable
//    Making an object where all variables are tied to the single object to make it more condensed

//adding in behaviors to the beast database.
//  possible rename to beast database
//just tack another variable on the end and make the map read them

//make map read the name of the movable to get its behavior (from function getBehavior)
