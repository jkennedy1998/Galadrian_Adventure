//hey! this is just for posting ideas to implement in the game without clogging up other class's data.
//formatting below
//new idea
//  aspects of new idea
//      personal comment about idea

//attacks and items affecting certain monster types more than others
//  bug like creatures (snakes spiders and bats) will be affected by an item more than a giant. (more dam)
//  new arg in monster where we do a integer id of a monster type. (ie 1 = bugLike, 2 = largeHumanoid)
//      would make a higher level of tactical thinking for the player.

//Changing Variable
//    Making an object where all variables are tied to the single object to make it more condensed

//enemies become enraged sometimes when the fall below 20% health. or become fearfull
    //basee off of their behavior in cartography? hat would be sick

//add more nonwalls to use in puzzles or to prevent players from going into an area that they are not ready for
//  buttons(on walls rhat you have to bump into)
//  locked doors and linked keys
//  lock picks?!?!
//  breakable terrain (like small trees or boulders that you can break with axes or shovels)
//  traped doors (on ground that you fall through and ones that are hidden in walls.)
//  something players can collect

//revamp items to go off of a weight based system
//  would allow players to gather more or less items based on what you need (more potions or more armor)
//    make armor an item that you can use to put on
//    make items able to be used outside the battlefied
//      would allow for some pretty cool lore based puzzles
